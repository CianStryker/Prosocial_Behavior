# Original Paper and Code Guide
- The authors' original paper as published is included under the file "Ethnic_riots_and_prosocial_behavior_evidence_from_kyrgyzstan". 
- Their paper that includes their online appendix is also included under the name "Original_Appendix". 
- The "Original Code" file contains all the code and datsets that the authors published online. Note: I only use a few of these to perform my replications and extension because this file contains all the code the authors wrote for their Appendix as well.

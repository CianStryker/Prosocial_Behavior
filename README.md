# Replication Project

This is my replicattion of the paper "Ethnic Riots and Prosocial Behavior: Evidence from Kyrgyzstan" written by Anselm Hager, Krzysztof Krakowski, and Max Schaub. Using survey data gathered in Osh, Kyrgyzstan after the 2010 ethnic riots that includes 1200 responses, this paper explored the question of whether exposure to ethnic riots has a negative effect on both in and out group prosocial behavior. Their conclusion was that exposure to violence during this riot negatively affected prosocial behavior to both the in and out-groups. 

In my paper I discuss the original authors' findings and place their theoretical model within the literature on ethnic violence and the 2010 Osh riots. I then expand on certain areas of their work that I believe warranted additional attention. Namely, I found that the effects of victimization on Kyrgyz resulted in different prosocial outcomes than the victimized Uzbeks. Kyrgyz who were exposed to violence in the riots expressed positive prosocial behavior towards Uzbeks (the out-group), This somewhat complicates the original authors' conclusions, but I believe this effect is important to note for understanding the larger effects of ethnic violence.

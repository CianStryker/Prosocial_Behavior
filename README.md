# Replication Project

This is my replication of the paper "Ethnic Riots and Prosocial Behavior: Evidence from Kyrgyzstan" written by Anselm Hager, Krzysztof Krakowski, and Max Schaub. They find that exposure to ethnic violence negatively affects prosocial behavior within and across ethnic groups in Osh, Kyrgyzstan. I was largely successful in replicating their main results and use their survey data of Kyrgyz and Uzbeks—the majority and minority ethnic groups of Osh—to expand upon their original work. I find that the prosocial behavior of Kyrgyz towards Uzbeks is somewhat positively affected by exposure violence during the riots. These results contradict the authors’ original findings that ethnic violence has a homogenous treatment effect. My models demonstrate that on the contrary ethnic violence can have a heterogenous treatment effect, which warrants further analysis of ethnic violence’s influence on interethnic relations.

In my paper I discuss the original authors' findings and expand on certain areas of their work that I believe warranted additional attention. Namely, I found that the effects of victimization on Kyrgyz resulted in different prosocial outcomes than the victimized Uzbeks. Kyrgyz who were exposed to violence in the riots expressed positive prosocial behavior towards Uzbeks (the out-group), This somewhat complicates the original authors' conclusions, but I believe this effect is important to note for understanding the larger effects of ethnic violence.

# Repo Guide

- The paper itself is listed as "Stryker_Prosocial_Behavior" and can be found in the main repo page. The markdown file for the paper is listed under the same name, but does not include the code for my replication's of the authors' original models. See the "Appendix" file for that code. 

- The datasets I used for my replication can be found under the file called "Data".

- My code for both my extensions and my replications of the relevant original figures can be found under the "Appendix" file. 

- The author's original paper, original appendix, original code for all figures, and all of thier original datasets can be found under the "Original Paper and Code" file. 

- The code for my shiny app can be found under the "Website" File.

# About Me

My name is Cian Stryker and I am a graduate student at Harvard University. I am pursuing a Master’s in Russian, Eastern European, and Central Asian studies with a focus on the Digital Silk Road, or the technological aspects of the Belt and Road Initiative. I am especially interested in the digital expansion of Chinese technology and data management systems in Central Asia. This replication was the final project for my ‘Models’ class at Harvard (GOV 1006).

# Appendix Guide

This Appendix contains the code for all of my extensions and also my replications of the authors' original figures that I mention in the paper itself. 
- The rmd files for both are listed under "Extensions" and "Original Replications" respectively. 
- The "Appendix_Data" file contains the datasets that I used for both the replications and extensions. 
- I have also included a screenshot of the authors' Figure 5 from their original paper. If you'd like, you could compare this screenshot to my replication of Figure 5 after you knit the "Original_Replications" rmd file.
